# P-Machine Homework Assignment 1

Final version of the P-Machine Homework Assignment.
Here, it is called "vm.c"

Code takes in strings with 3 values each:

For example,

7 0 45

7 = The operator code. 
0 = The lexograpchial level
45 = The "m" value, or the value that will be implemented/modified. 

Code will output instructions as they happen, and deliver the final result through an output string (printf).
